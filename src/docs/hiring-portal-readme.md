## File Storage

The hiring portal uses AWS S3 for storing resumes:

- Resumes are stored in a dedicated 'resumes' folder in the configured S3 bucket
- File naming follows a pattern: `user_[userId]_[timestamp]_[random].[extension]`
- Direct S3 URLs are stored in the database for secure access

## Required Environment Variables

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
```

## Testing

A test script is provided at `src/scripts/test-hiring-portal.js` to verify all functionality. 
To run the tests:

```bash
node src/scripts/test-hiring-portal.js
```

Make sure to set the `API_URL` environment variable if your API is not running at the default location.

## Database Models

### Job Model
- Basic job details (title, company, description)
- Skills and eligibility requirements
- Status tracking (open, closed, completed)
- Mandatory organization association

### JobApplication Model
- Links users to jobs
- Stores resume S3 URL
- Tracks application status
- Records application timestamps
