## How to Run

For macOS development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Build the TypeScript files
pnpm tsc

# Run the application
pnpm run mac-dev-build
```

## Testing the Functionality

We've added several ways to test:

1. **Manual Testing**
   Follow the guides in `/src/docs/hiring-portal-testing-guide.md`

2. **Automated Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run just the hiring portal tests
   pnpm run test:hiring
   
   # Build, run, and test in one go
   pnpm run hiring:all
   ```

3. **Using Postman**
   Import the API endpoints from the documentation

## Configuration

Make sure to set up your environment variables based on the example in `s3-env-example.txt`, especially the AWS S3 credentials which are required for resume uploads.

## Next Steps

1. Create a frontend interface for the hiring portal
